    "- A completed `statement-of-originality.md`, found in the root of the forked gitlab repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are performed by pushing to your forked GitLab assignment repository. For a refresher on forking and cloning repositories, please refer to `Lab 1`. Issues with your Git repo (with the exception of a CECS/ANU wide Gitlab failure) will not be considered as grounds for an extension. You will also need to add your details below.

    "* Backup your assignment to your Gitlab repo often. \n",
    "* Extra reading and research will be required. Make sure you include all references in your Statement of Originality. If this does not occur, at best marks will be deduced. Otherwise, academic misconduct processes will be followed.\n",
    "* For answers requiring free form written text, use the designated cells denoted by `YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER HERE` -- double click on the cell to write inside them.\n",
    "* For all coding questions please write your code after the comment `YOUR CODE HERE`.\n",
    "* In the process of testing your code, you can insert more cells or use print statements for debugging, but when submitting your file remember to remove these cells and calls respectively. You are welcome to add additional cells to the final submission, provided they add value to the overall piece.\n",
    "* You will be marked on the **correctness** and **readability** of your answers, including your code. If your marker can't understand your answer/code, then marks may be deducted. \n",
    "* Before submitting, restart the kernel in Jupiter Lab and re-run all cells before submitting your code. This will ensure the namespace has not kept any old variables, as these won't come across in submission and your code will not run. Without this, you could lose a significant number of marks.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Video content is being produced, transported and consumed in more ways and by devices than ever. To facilitate this process, seamless interaction between video producing, transporting and consuming devices is required. The difference in avaliable resources, network bandwidth and video representation types between devices requires a mechanism for video content adaptation and translation. One such mechanism is video transcoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### So What is Video Transcoding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Video transcoding (sometimes refered to as encoding) is the process of converting a video from one digital format to another. A format is defined by characteristics such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bit rate\n",
    "- Frame rate\n",
    "- Spatial resolution\n",
    "- Coding syntax\n",
    "- Content\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the earliest applications of transcoding was to adapt the bit rate of a precompressed video stream to a channel bandwidth. For example, a TV program may be originally compressed at a high bit rate for studio applications, but later needs to be transmitted over a public channel at a much lower bit rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what are we doing with this?\n",
    "Transcoding is a computationally demanding process and several methods has been proposed in order to increase its efficiency. Runtime scheduling of transcoding jobs in multicore and cloud environments is hard as resource requirements may not be known before hand. Currently, for video transcoding jobs, one has to rely on worst-case values which lead to an over provisioning of resources. This is due to the fact that the resource requirement of a transcoding job is highly dependent on the video data to be converted and its conversion parameters. In order to allow such distributed and multicore systems to overcome the problem of over provisioning, a method for predicting the resource requirement of each job is required.  If the scheduler can predict accurately how long each job would take to execute on a given platform, it can make an optimal decision, returning results faster, possibly minimizing energy, waiting time and maximizing throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*****\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "The presented dataset (`transcoding_data.csv`) contains 23 columns which include input and output video characteristics, along with their transcoding time and memory resource requirements, while transcoding videos to different but valid formats. The dataset was collected based on experiments on an Intel i7-3720QM CPU through randomly picking output parameters of a video transcoding application. The attributes present in the dataset and their information are presented in the table below.\n",
